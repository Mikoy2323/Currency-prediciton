# ðŸ’± Currency Prediction System  

A **currency forecasting system** that predicts future exchange rates for multiple currencies and provides **investment recommendations** based on model confidence.  

## ðŸš€ Overview  
This project uses **time series forecasting** to predict future values of various currencies. For each currency, a **dedicated model** is trained using its historical data. Predictions are updated daily and visualized through an interactive **Power BI dashboard**.  

### Key Features  
âœ… **Separate model per currency** â€“ each currency has its own time-series prediction model.  
âœ… **Daily automated updates** â€“ a script retrains models and generates fresh forecasts every day.  
âœ… **Investment recommendations** â€“ highlights currencies that might be worth investing in based on predictions.  
âœ… **Power BI integration** â€“ all forecasts and historical data are connected to a Power BI dashboard for interactive analysis.  
âœ… **Risk Indicator (`WspÃ³Å‚czynnik ryzyka`)** â€“ based on **RMAPE (Relative Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**, which measures prediction accuracy:  
   - **Lower score = better prediction (lower risk)**  
   - **Higher score = worse prediction (higher risk)**  

## ðŸ“Š How It Works  
1. Collect historical exchange rate data for each currency.  
2. Train an individual **time series model** for each currency.  
3. Generate **future predictions** for each currency.  
4. Calculate **RMAPE** as a confidence indicator for each model.  
5. Update results daily via an automated script.  
6. Visualize and analyze everything in **Power BI**.
